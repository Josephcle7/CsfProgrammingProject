=====================

This is my attempt at making a 3 minute composition in Java.

I hope to base this composition off of a short story about a character named Harry in a book called "Last Exit to Brooklyn" by Hubert Selby Jr.
I aim to make this composition about 3 minutes long and contain 2 channels of sound.
